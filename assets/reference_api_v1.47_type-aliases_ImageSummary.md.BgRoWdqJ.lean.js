It provides a more detailed view of the platform-specific image manifests or other image-attached data like build attestations.

This field is empty if the image was pulled from an image registry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RepoDigests</code></td><td><code>string</code>[]</td><td>List of content-addressable digests of locally available image manifests that the image is referenced from. Multiple manifests can refer to the same image. These digests are usually only available if the image was either pulled from a registry, or if the image was pushed to a registry, which is when the manifest is generated and its digest calculated.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RepoTags</code></td><td><code>string</code>[]</td><td>List of image names/tags in the local image cache that reference this image. Multiple image tags can refer to the same image, and this list may be empty if no tags reference the image, in which case the image is &quot;untagged&quot;, in which case it can still be referenced by its ID.</td></tr><tr><td><code>SharedSize</code></td><td><code>number</code></td><td>Total size of image layers that are shared between this image and other images. This size is not calculated by default. <code>-1</code> indicates that the value has not been set / calculated.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Size</code></td><td><code>number</code></td><td>Total size of the image including all layers it is composed of.</td></tr><tr><td><code>VirtualSize</code>?</td><td><code>number</code></td><td>Total size of the image including all layers it is composed of.
